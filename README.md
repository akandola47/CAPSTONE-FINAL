# Overview
The mission of this project is to analyze the differnce between soccer teams as they play as the home team versus the away team and if the idea of home field advantage actually exists and how it coluld affect goals scored. This project uses the World_Cup_Matches.csv dataset, which has alot of data from a previous world cup including what stadium and city the match was played and the amount of goals the team and away team both had. 

## Prerequisites

1. Git
1. Python 3.7+ (3.11+ preferred)
1. VS Code Editor

## Before You Begin

1. Fork this starter repo into your GitHub.
1. Clone your repo down to your machine.

## Create a Python Virtual Environment

We will create a local Python virtual environment to isolate our project's third-party dependencies from other projects.

1. Open a terminal window in VS Code.
1. Use the built-in Python utility venv to create a new virtual environment named `.venv` in the current directory.

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Verify you get a new .venv directory in your project.
We use .venv as the name to keep it away from our project files. 

## Activate the Virtual Environment

In the same VS Code terminal window, activate the virtual environment. On MacOS:

```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Verify you see the virtual environment name (.venv) in your terminal prompt.

## Install Dependencies into the Virtual Environment

We keep the list of third-party libraries needed in a file named requirements.txt.
Use the pip utility to install the libraries listed in requirements.txt into our active virtual environment. 

Make sure you can see the .venv name in your terminal prompt before running this command.

```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
